# CRITICAL FIX DEPLOYED - CLICK HANDLER RESTORED âœ…

## Issue Identified
- When we removed the conflicting original script, we accidentally removed the click handler setup
- The `startBackend` function existed but wasn't attached to the button's click event
- Button was visible but non-functional

## Fix Implemented
- Added `setupClickHandler()` function with retry logic
- Properly attaches both `addEventListener('click', startBackend)` and `onclick = startBackend`
- Enhanced debugging to confirm click handler attachment
- Retry mechanism (up to 10 attempts) to ensure button is found

## Deployment Status
- **Commit**: `0ceab37` - CRITICAL FIX: Add click handler for Start WebQx Server button
- **Status**: âœ… DEPLOYED to GitHub Pages
- **CDN Update**: 2-3 minutes

## Testing Instructions
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages CDN update
2. Open https://webqx.github.io/webqx/
3. Hard refresh with `Ctrl+Shift+R` (bypass cache)
4. Check browser console for: "âœ… Click handler attached to Start WebQx Server button"
5. Click "Start WebQx Server" button - should now work!

## Expected Behavior
- Button should be clickable and show "Starting..." when clicked
- Should trigger remote start on port 8080 endpoint
- Status should update to show remote start initiated

**The button should now work properly! ðŸŽ‰**
