== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this HIPAA compliant? =
Yes, WebQX is designed with HIPAA compliance in mind. The platform includes:
* End-to-end encryption for all patient data
* Comprehensive audit logging
* Role-based access controls
* Secure authentication mechanisms
* Data breach notification systems

However, HIPAA compliance also requires proper configuration, staff training, and business associate agreements. Consult with healthcare compliance experts for your specific implementation.

= What EHR systems does WebQX integrate with? =
WebQX supports both open-source and commercial EHR systems through:
* **Direct Integration**: OpenEMR, OpenMRS, HospitalRun, GNU Health
* **FHIR APIs**: Epic, Cerner, Allscripts, NextGen, and any FHIR R4 compliant system
* **HL7 Interfaces**: Legacy systems via Mirth Connect
* **Custom APIs**: RESTful web services for proprietary systems

= Can I use this without medical training? =
While WebQX provides the technical platform, it's designed for use by licensed healthcare professionals. The system should be implemented and managed by qualified medical personnel who understand healthcare regulations and patient safety requirements.

= Does this work with my existing WordPress theme? =
Yes! WebQX is designed to work with any properly coded WordPress theme. The healthcare components are embedded using shortcodes and styled to match your site's appearance.
