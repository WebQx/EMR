# API Logic

This directory contains the API logic and infrastructure for the WebQx EHR system, providing RESTful and GraphQL endpoints for all system functionality.

## Overview

The API layer provides secure, versioned, and well-documented interfaces for all system operations, supporting both internal modules and external integrations.

## Directory Structure

- **v1/** - Version 1 API endpoints and controllers
- **v2/** - Version 2 API endpoints with enhanced features
- **middleware/** - Common middleware for authentication, logging, etc.
- **authentication/** - API authentication and token management
- **validation/** - Request validation and data sanitization
- **documentation/** - API documentation and schema definitions
- **error-handling/** - Centralized error handling and response formatting
- **rate-limiting/** - API rate limiting and throttling
- **versioning/** - API version management and compatibility

## API Standards

- **RESTful Design** - Following REST principles and HTTP standards
- **GraphQL Support** - Flexible query language for complex data needs
- **OpenAPI/Swagger** - Comprehensive API documentation
- **JSON:API** - Standardized JSON response format
- **OAuth 2.0** - Secure authentication and authorization
- **Rate Limiting** - Protection against abuse and overuse

## Security Features

- **JWT Authentication** - Stateless token-based authentication
- **Role-Based Access** - Fine-grained permission controls
- **Input Validation** - Comprehensive request validation
- **SQL Injection Protection** - Parameterized queries and ORM
- **XSS Prevention** - Output encoding and sanitization
- **CORS Management** - Cross-origin request policies

## Getting Started

1. Review API documentation in the documentation/ directory
2. Set up authentication credentials and API keys
3. Configure rate limiting and security policies
4. Test endpoints using provided examples
5. Implement error handling in client applications

## Monitoring

All API endpoints include:
- Performance metrics and monitoring
- Audit logging for compliance
- Error tracking and alerting
- Usage analytics and reporting
