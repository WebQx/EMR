## Overview

The EHR integration layer provides a standardized interface for connecting with various EHR systems and managing healthcare data exchange. All modules in this directory follow consistent patterns for:

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly feedback
- **Loading States**: Visual indicators for ongoing operations
- **TypeScript Types**: Explicit typing for all functions, props, and state variables
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes and compliance with accessibility standards
- **Logging**: Detailed logging for success/failure status and error details
- **Code Documentation**: Comprehensive comments for maintainability

## Structure

- `types/` - Common TypeScript interfaces and types
- `services/` - Core EHR integration services
- `hooks/` - React hooks for EHR operations
- `components/` - Reusable EHR UI components
- `utils/` - Utility functions and helpers

## Integration Standards

All EHR integrations must implement:
1. Standardized error handling patterns
2. Consistent loading state management
3. Comprehensive TypeScript typing
4. Full accessibility compliance
5. Detailed operation logging
6. Clear code documentation
