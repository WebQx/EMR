- **Patient safety** through proper IP governance

### Scope
This framework applies to all:
- Source code contributions
- Documentation and technical specifications
- Healthcare workflow definitions
- Clinical decision support algorithms
- Integration specifications and APIs
- Research publications and whitepapers

## ‚öñÔ∏è Licensing Framework

### Primary License
**Apache License 2.0** serves as the foundation license for all WebQX contributions, providing:
- Permissive open source licensing
- Patent protection for contributors and users
- Commercial use compatibility
- Healthcare industry acceptance

### Dual Licensing Model
WebQX operates under a dual licensing approach:

#### Open Source Track
- **License:** Apache 2.0
- **Use Cases:** Academic research, non-commercial healthcare projects, community contributions
- **Restrictions:** Must comply with Apache 2.0 terms
- **Cost:** Free

#### Commercial Track
- **License:** Custom commercial licenses available
- **Use Cases:** Proprietary healthcare products, enterprise deployments, regulated environments
- **Benefits:** Additional support, indemnification, custom terms
- **Cost:** Negotiated licensing fees

### Healthcare Addendum
All contributors must also comply with healthcare-specific licensing terms addressing:
- Patient data protection requirements
- Clinical safety obligations
- Regulatory compliance responsibilities
- Medical device considerations

## üë• Contributor Requirements

1. **[IP Assignment Addendum](../legal/ip-addendum.md)**
   - Copyright assignment to WebQX Health
   - Patent grant and defensive pledge
   - Healthcare-specific warranties

2. **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**
   - Individual or corporate CLA
   - Electronic signature required
   - Maintained in contributor database

3. **Healthcare Compliance Acknowledgment**
   - Understanding of HIPAA/GDPR requirements

```

### Healthcare Contributions
Special considerations for healthcare-related contributions:

#### Clinical Knowledge
- **Medical expertise** contributions require qualification disclosure
- **Clinical workflows** must be based on published standards
- **Medical algorithms** require clinical validation
- **Safety-critical code** subject to enhanced review

#### Regulatory Implications
- **FDA considerations** for medical device features
- **CE marking** requirements for European deployment
- **Quality management** system compliance
- **Clinical evaluation** documentation

## üî¨ Patent Management

### Patent Grant
Contributors provide comprehensive patent grants:

#### Scope of Grant
- **Perpetual, worldwide** license to all patent claims
- **Non-exclusive** rights for open source use
- **Defensive patent pledge** against project users
- **Clinical safety exception** for patient protection

#### Patent Disclosure
Contributors must disclose:
- **Existing patents** covering contributions
- **Pending applications** related to contributions
- **Third-party patents** potentially affecting the project
- **Licensing obligations** from employers or other entities

### Defensive Patent Strategy
WebQX maintains a defensive patent approach:

#### Principles
- **Protect innovation** without hindering interoperability
- **Defensive use only** - no offensive patent litigation
- **Open source commitment** - patents available for OSS projects
- **Healthcare focus** - promote medical technology advancement

#### Patent Pool Participation
- **Open healthcare patent** pools where beneficial
- **Cross-licensing** agreements with compatible projects
- **Prior art documentation** to prevent frivolous patents
- **Industry collaboration** on healthcare standards

## üîó Third-Party IP

### Dependency Management
Careful management of third-party intellectual property:

#### License Compatibility
- **Apache 2.0 compatible** licenses preferred
- **Permissive licenses** (MIT, BSD) generally acceptable
- **Copyleft licenses** (GPL, LGPL) require special handling
- **Proprietary licenses** must be explicitly approved

#### Due Diligence Process
1. **License Review:** Verify compatibility with Apache 2.0
2. **Patent Analysis:** Check for patent obligations
3. **Attribution Requirements:** Document proper attribution
4. **Update Tracking:** Monitor license changes in dependencies

### Healthcare-Specific Dependencies
Special attention to healthcare libraries:

#### Medical Standards Libraries
- **HL7 FHIR** implementations and licensing
- **DICOM** toolkit licensing considerations
- **Medical coding** systems (ICD, SNOMED) licensing
- **Clinical decision** support rule licensing

#### Regulatory Compliance
- **FDA-cleared** software component licensing
- **CE-marked** medical device software licensing
- **Quality system** documentation requirements
- **Clinical validation** evidence requirements

## üè• Healthcare-Specific Considerations
