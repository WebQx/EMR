# Conflict Resolution Guidelines

## Understanding Conflicts
Conflicts occur when changes from different sources overlap or contradict each other. Understanding the nature of these conflicts is the first step in resolving them effectively.

## Steps for Conflict Resolution

1. **Identify the Conflict:**
   - Review the conflicting changes and understand the reasons behind them.

2. **Rebase and Merge:**
   - Use rebasing to integrate changes from the base branch while preserving your commits.
   - Merging allows you to combine different branches and resolve conflicts in a single commit.

3. **Collaborate:**
   - Communicate with team members to understand their changes and intentions.
   - Utilize tools like pull requests to discuss and resolve conflicts collaboratively.

4. **Test After Resolving:**
   - After resolving conflicts, run tests to ensure that the changes do not introduce new issues.
   - Validate that the merged code behaves as expected.

## Scenarios

- **Module-Level Conflicts:**
  - Conflicts arising from modifications in the same module by different developers can lead to integration challenges. Always ensure to coordinate changes in shared modules.

- **Dependency Overlaps:**
  - When two branches introduce conflicting dependencies, itâ€™s crucial to analyze which versions are required and how they can coexist.
