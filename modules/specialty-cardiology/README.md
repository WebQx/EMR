# Cardiology Specialty Module

This module provides comprehensive cardiology-specific functionality for the WebQx EHR system.

## Purpose

Supports cardiologists and cardiovascular care teams with specialized tools for cardiac diagnosis, treatment planning, procedure documentation, and patient monitoring.

## Features

- **ECG Integration** - Electrocardiogram capture, analysis, and interpretation
- **Cardiac Imaging** - Echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and CT integration
- **Hemodynamic Monitoring** - Real-time cardiac parameter tracking
- **Procedure Documentation** - Cardiac catheterization, interventions, and surgery notes
- **Risk Stratification** - Cardiovascular risk assessment tools
- **Device Management** - Pacemaker, ICD, and cardiac device tracking

## Initial Setup

1. Configure ECG system integration and analysis protocols
2. Set up cardiac imaging workflows and storage
3. Implement hemodynamic monitoring interfaces
4. Configure procedure templates and documentation workflows
5. Set up cardiac risk calculators and decision support tools
6. Integrate cardiac device databases and follow-up protocols

## Clinical Areas Supported

- **Interventional Cardiology** - Catheterization and coronary interventions
- **Electrophysiology** - Arrhythmia diagnosis and ablation procedures
- **Heart Failure** - Chronic care management and monitoring
- **Preventive Cardiology** - Risk assessment and lifestyle interventions
- **Cardiac Surgery** - Pre/post-operative care and documentation
- **Pediatric Cardiology** - Congenital heart disease management

## Diagnostic Tools

- **ECG Analysis** - Automated rhythm and morphology analysis
- **Stress Testing** - Exercise and pharmacological stress protocols
- **Cardiac Biomarkers** - Troponin, BNP, and other cardiac markers
- **Risk Calculators** - ASCVD, GRACE, TIMI risk scoring
- **Image Quantification** - Ejection fraction, wall motion analysis

## Integration Standards

Supports HL7 FHIR for cardiac data exchange, DICOM for imaging, and IEEE 11073 for device connectivity.
