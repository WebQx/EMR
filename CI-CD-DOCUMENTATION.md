```

### GitHub Environment Protection

1. **Staging Environment**:
   - No approval required
   - Deploy from `develop` branch only

2. **Production Environment**:
   - Required reviewers: DevOps team, Lead Developer
   - Deployment branches: `main` only
   - Environment secrets for production configuration

3. **Production Rollback Environment**:
   - Required reviewers: Senior DevOps, Technical Lead
   - Emergency bypass available

## 🚀 Deployment Process

### Staging Deployment

1. **Automatic Trigger**: Push to `develop` branch
2. **CI Validation**: All tests must pass
3. **Deployment**: Automatic deployment to staging
4. **Verification**: Health checks and smoke tests
5. **Notification**: Team notification of deployment status

### Production Deployment

1. **Manual Trigger**: Use GitHub Actions UI
   - Go to Actions → Deploy to Production
   - Select version (commit SHA or tag)
   - Provide deployment reason
   - Enable team notifications

2. **Pre-deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Example manual trigger
   gh workflow run deploy-production.yml \
     -f version=main \
     -f reason="Monthly release with new features" \
     -f notify_teams=true
   ```

3. **Approval Process**:
   - Automated validation checks
   - Manual approval from designated reviewers
   - Security and compliance verification

4. **Deployment Execution**:
   - Pre-deployment backup creation
   - Production build generation
   - Zero-downtime deployment
   - Comprehensive health verification

5. **Post-deployment**:
   - Extended monitoring period
   - Post-deployment backup
   - Team notifications
   - Documentation updates

### Rollback Process

1. **Emergency Rollback**:
   ```bash
   # Immediate rollback (bypasses some checks)
   gh workflow run rollback.yml \
     -f environment=production \
     -f version=previous \
     -f reason="Critical security vulnerability" \
     -f emergency=true
   ```

2. **Standard Rollback**:
   ```bash
   # Standard rollback with full safety checks
   gh workflow run rollback.yml \
     -f environment=production \
     -f version=v1.2.3 \
     -f reason="Performance regression" \
     -f emergency=false
   ```

## 🔄 Rollback Procedures

### Automated Rollback Triggers

The system provides rapid rollback capabilities for various scenarios:

- **Failed Health Checks**: Automatic rollback if health checks fail
- **Performance Degradation**: Monitor response times and system stability
- **Security Incidents**: Emergency rollback procedures
- **Data Integrity Issues**: Rapid recovery mechanisms

### Rollback Types

1. **Previous Version Rollback**:
   - Automatically determines the last successful deployment
   - Restores to the most recent stable state

2. **Specific Version Rollback**:
   - Target a specific commit SHA or release tag
   - Useful for reverting to known good states

3. **Emergency Rollback**:
   - Bypasses some safety checks for critical situations
   - Requires senior approval even in emergency mode

### Backup Strategy

- **Pre-deployment Backups**: Created before every deployment
- **Post-deployment Backups**: Created after successful deployments
- **Rollback Backups**: Created before rollback execution
- **Retention Policy**: 
  - Staging: 7 days
  - Production: 365 days
  - Critical backups: Permanent retention

## 📊 Monitoring and Notifications

### Health Check Endpoints

The system monitors these critical endpoints:

- `/health` - Basic application health
- `/api/health` - API service health
- `/version` - Deployment version information
- `/patient-portal` - Patient portal accessibility
- `/admin-console` - Admin interface (should require auth)

### Notification Channels

#### Slack Integration

Configure Slack webhooks for real-time notifications:

```json
{
  "deployment_success": "#devops-notifications",
  "deployment_failure": "#alerts-critical",
  "rollback_initiated": "#alerts-urgent",
  "security_alerts": "#security-team"
}
```

#### Email Notifications

GitHub Actions automatically sends emails to:
- Repository watchers
- Deployment reviewers
- Configured team lists

### Monitoring Metrics

- **Deployment Success Rate**: Target > 95%
- **Rollback Frequency**: Target < 5% of deployments
- **Deployment Duration**: 
  - Staging: < 15 minutes
  - Production: < 30 minutes
- **Health Check Response Time**: < 2 seconds
- **System Uptime**: Target > 99.9%

## 🔒 Security and Compliance

### Healthcare Compliance Checks

The pipeline includes specialized healthcare compliance validations:

1. **Sensitive Data Scanning**:
   - PHI (Protected Health Information) pattern detection
   - Hardcoded secrets detection
   - API key exposure prevention

2. **HIPAA Compliance Validation**:
   - Encryption requirements verification
   - Audit logging confirmation
   - Access control validation

3. **Security Scanning**:
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Container security analysis
   - Code quality and security analysis

### Access Controls

- **Branch Protection**: Required reviews and status checks
- **Environment Protection**: Manual approval gates for production
- **Secret Management**: Secure handling of sensitive configuration
- **Audit Logging**: Complete deployment history tracking

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. CI Pipeline Failures

**Issue**: Tests failing in CI but passing locally

```bash
# Solution: Check environment differences
npm run test -- --verbose
npm run type-check

# Ensure dependencies are properly installed
npm ci
```

**Issue**: Docker build failures

```bash
# Solution: Check Dockerfile and build context
docker build -t webqx-test .
docker run --rm webqx-test npm test
```

#### 2. Deployment Failures

**Issue**: Health checks failing after deployment

```bash
# Check application logs
railway logs --tail 100

# Verify environment variables
railway vars

# Test endpoints manually
curl -f https://your-app.railway.app/health
```

**Issue**: Database connection failures

```bash
# Verify database configuration
railway connect <database-service>

# Check database health
pg_isready -h <host> -p <port>
```

#### 3. Rollback Issues

**Issue**: Rollback health checks failing

```bash
# Verify target version is valid
git show <target-version>

# Check previous deployment logs
gh run list --workflow=deploy-production.yml

# Manual health check
curl -v https://webqx.health/health
```

### Emergency Procedures

#### Critical System Down

1. **Immediate Response**:
   ```bash
   # Emergency rollback to last known good version
   gh workflow run rollback.yml \
     -f environment=production \
     -f version=previous \
     -f reason="System down - emergency recovery" \
     -f emergency=true
   ```

2. **Communication**:
   - Notify all stakeholders immediately
   - Update status page
   - Document incident details

3. **Recovery Validation**:
   - Verify system functionality
   - Check data integrity
   - Monitor for 24 hours

#### Security Incident

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   ```bash
   # Stop current deployment if in progress
   gh run cancel <run-id>
   
   # Emergency rollback
   gh workflow run rollback.yml \
     -f environment=production \
     -f version=previous \
     -f reason="Security incident - immediate rollback" \
     -f emergency=true
   ```

2. **Security Response**:
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Assess security impact
   - Apply security patches
   - Re-deploy with fixes
