## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing new standards in this directory:

1. **Create a dedicated subdirectory** for each standard
2. **Follow the established pattern** from existing implementations
3. **Include comprehensive documentation** and examples
4. **Implement proper validation** and error handling
5. **Add appropriate tests** for all functionality
6. **Update the main interoperability README** to document the new standard

## Contributing

If you're interested in contributing support for any of these standards or have suggestions for additional standards to support, please:

1. Create an issue in the GitHub repository
2. Provide justification and use cases
3. Include links to official documentation
4. Consider the impact on existing functionality

## Standards Evaluation Criteria

When evaluating new standards for inclusion:

- **Industry adoption**: How widely is the standard used?
- **Official specification**: Is there a stable, official specification?
- **Compatibility**: How well does it integrate with existing standards?
- **Use cases**: What specific problems does it solve for WebQX™ users?
- **Maintenance**: What is the ongoing maintenance burden?
- **Community**: Is there an active community around the standard?
