    });
  });

  describe('Algorithm Accuracy', () => {
    it('should calculate correct dosage per NCCN guidelines', () => {
      // Test with known reference values
    });
  });
});
```

#### Running Tests

 * @param {LabResultFilter} filters - Result filtering options
 * @returns {Promise<LabResult[]>} Filtered lab results
 * @throws {AuthenticationError} If user not authenticated
 * @throws {AuthorizationError} If user not authorized for patient
 * @medical_disclaimer Results for informational purposes only
 * @hipaa_compliant Yes - no PHI in logs or errors
